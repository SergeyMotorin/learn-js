# Numbers

In modern JavaScript, there are two types of numbers:

1. Regular numbers in JavaScript are stored in 64-bit format [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008_revision), also known as "double precision floating point numbers". These are numbers that we're using most of the time, and we'll talk about them in this chapter.

2. BigInt numbers, to represent integers of arbitrary length. They are sometimes needed, because a regular number can't safely exceed <code>2<sup>53</sup></code> or be less than <code>-2<sup>53</sup></code>. As bigints are used in few special areas, we devote them a special chapter <info:bigint>.
